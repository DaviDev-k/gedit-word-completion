Gedit Word Completion Plugin

This plugin uses the new GtkSourceCompletionWords provider supplied with the new
GtkSourceCompletion framework to provide a completion provider which can
complete from words in all open buffers.

You will need to have gedit, gtksourceview and pygtksourceview built from git
for this plugin to work.
